# Genuary challenges!


## Genurary 1 - Draw 10,000 of something.

What could be the worst way to draw a cube?  With 10,000 dodecahedrons of course!  BuildBee MakeCode has automatic loop protection to protect you from going too crazy with shape generation and burning your browser to the ground.  What a great way to test that.
